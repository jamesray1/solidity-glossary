Solidity is written using C++. If you are new to object oriented programming languages like C++, and are unfamiliar with any terms that you encounter, then you can refer to this glossary or to an educational website for C++ such as `learncpp.com <http://www.learncpp.com>`_.
Ordered from simplest to most complex
`Logical operators <http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/36-logical-operators/>`_ 
`Relational operators <http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/35-relational-operators-comparisons/>`_
`Keccak <http://keccak.noekeon.org/specs_summary.html>`_: Solidity doesn't use the newest specification available, it uses the one submitted to the SHA3 competition.

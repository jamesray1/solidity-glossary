Solidity is written using C++. If you are new to object oriented programming languages like C++, and are unfamiliar with any terms that you encounter, then you can refer to this glossary or to an educational website for C++ such as `learncpp.com <http://www.learncpp.com>`_.

The following glossary list is ordered roughly from the simplest to the most complex. Topics at the top of the list tend to be a precursor to understanding topics later in the list.

1. `Logical operators <http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/36-logical-operators/>`_ 
2. `Relational operators <http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/35-relational-operators-comparisons/>`_
3. `Assert <http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/7-12a-assert-and-static_assert/>`
3. `Keccak <http://keccak.noekeon.org/specs_summary.html>`_. Note that Solidity doesn't use the newest specification available, it uses the one submitted to the SHA3 competition.
